Bower is a package manager, designed to allow you to add further functionality to your project. Similar to 'npm' or 'ruby gems', files
are added to your bower file that add 'dependencies' to your project. In short, the functionality is added through code written elsewhere,
your project then requires it (or becomes dependent on it), in order to run. The bower file defines that code and pulls it into your
project.
