#:notebook: Protractor :notebook:

**Protractor is an 'End 2 End' testing (Feature testing) tool for use with AngularJS**
**To begin with Protractor, you will need 'Node' and the 'Node Package Manager' installed on your system.**
**If they are not already, head to the 'npm' walkthrough found in this repo.**

```
STEP 1: Run 'npm install protractor -g'.
```

**You will also need Selenium installed on your system. Protractor install comes with Selenium so...**

```
STEP 2: Run 'webdriver-manager update', you will see the Selenium Standalone Server is now installed on your system
        as well as the Chromedriver.
```

```
STEP 3: Run 'npm init' to setup your package.json (Protractor is testing Angular, so is Frontend), then run 'npm install protractor --save'.
```
